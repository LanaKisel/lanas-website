    <h2>My Europe bucket list:</h2>
      <h3>Barcelona, Spain</h3>
       <p>Barcelona contains both the authentically historic and the wildly bizarre. From the scenic trails of the colorful Park Güell to the romantic narrow alleys of Barri Gòtic; from the beachside nightclubs to the city's dozens of sacred churches and architectural marvels, this city by the sea seems to attract all types: the adventurer, the couple, the partier, the culture lover and more with an almost overwhelming variety of things to do. </p>
